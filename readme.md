# Web Portfolio

### Deployed
https://web-portfolio-seven.vercel.app/

## What is it?
Personal project to showcase my skills in web development

## What can it do?
A responsive website that contains information about my skills in software development, navigate projects that I made, and contact me using via email while displaying a 3D particle effect for tranistions.

## How was it made?
HTML and CSS was used on all the styles and text with javascript helping with the transitions and buttons. Utilize three.js as a javascript library to create the 3D particle effect

## How to use it?
Using the tabs to navigate each section. Can hover over particles effect to expand it for a neat animation.

### Notes:
* Able to edit the particle efect by adding "#debug" at the end of the address 
* Problems with IOS devices not rendering particle effects so I replaced it with pictures
* Might add a "turn off particle" feature for low end devices
